## Project Notes
Random direct SQL queries on VeeamReporting (AKA ARE YOU READY TO BREAK YOUR PRODUCTION ? :))

Highly discourage to use the scripts and check if there is a powershell alternative. These one should only be use if there is no other way around. The VeeamReporting can change between update and thus script might not work in the next/previous version

subdirectory refers to the build number they were tested against. eg 09.05.00.001538 refers to 1538 a.k.a 9.5.1538 aka 9.5 update 3.
